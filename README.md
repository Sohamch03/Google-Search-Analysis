# Google-Search-Analysis
🚀 Google Trends Data Analysis Project using Python
🔍 Powered by PyTrends | 📊 Visualized with Matplotlib & Seaborn

I recently completed an end-to-end data analysis project where I used the PyTrends API (an unofficial API for Google Trends) to uncover search behavior across the globe.

Here's what the project accomplished:

1️⃣ Dynamic Keyword Tracking:
Developed a reusable code structure where changing just the keyword allows dynamic tracking of search trends.

2️⃣ Top 15 Countries Visualization:
Identified the top 15 countries with the highest interest for a keyword, and visualized the results using bar charts via Seaborn.

3️⃣ World Map Representation (Optional enhancement):
(Planned) integration with Plotly or GeoPandas to show a heatmap of global interest.

4️⃣ Trend Over Time:
Extracted and plotted how interest in a keyword has evolved over the last 12 months using time series plots.

5️⃣ Keyword Comparison:
Compared multiple related keywords (like “cloud computing”, “data science”, and “machine learning”) on a single graph to understand their relative popularity.

🔧 Tech Stack:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

PyTrends API

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project deepened my skills in working with APIs, data wrangling, and visual storytelling with Python.
If you're into data-driven insights, I'd love to connect and discuss more!
